# Roblox RGB Keyboard Scripts

A pair of Lua scripts for simulating RGB backlighting effects on keyboard models in Roblox. Designed for flexibility, randomized timing, and easy customization.

## Scripts

- **color_prog.lua**  
  Controls a single part with a looping RGB color cycle. Includes randomized timing and startup offset for natural variation.

- **color_prog_multi.lua**  
  Controls multiple parts within a model, creating a wave-like RGB effect. Each part updates with a staggered delay, and timing is randomized per instance.

## Features

- Adjustable RGB bounds (`rMin`, `rMax`, etc.)
- Randomized `waitTime`, `waveDelay`, and `loopOffset` for each script
- Verbose logging for debugging
- Scalable part initialization using `partno` and `WaitForChild`

## Usage

Place the appropriate script inside the target part or model. Customize the parameters at the top of each script to match your setup. Scripts loop continuously once started.

# üïπÔ∏è 1-Bit Video Player for Roblox Studio

A modular pipeline for converting grayscale videos into chunked Lua frame data, optimized for Roblox Studio playback.

---

## üì¶ Overview

This toolchain lets you:

1. Convert any video into 1-bit hex-encoded frames  
2. Split those frames into Studio-safe Lua chunks  
3. Mass-import the chunks into Roblox Studio  
4. Play back the video using a custom renderer

---

## üß∞ Requirements

Install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow pyautogui pyperclip keyboard
```

---

## üéûÔ∏è Step 1: Convert Video to Lua Frames

Use `videoToLua16.py` to extract and encode frames:

```bash
python videoToLua16.py input.mp4 -o output.lua --threshold 128 --width 256 --height 144
```

- `input.mp4`: your source video  
- `output.lua`: full-frame hex strings  
- `--threshold`: grayscale cutoff (0‚Äì255)  
- `--width` / `--height`: resolution (must match your renderer)

---

## üìö Step 2: Chunk Lua Frames for Studio

Use `luaBitmapChunker16.py` to split the output into Studio-safe blobs:

```bash
python luaBitmapChunker16.py output.lua -o "game_files/ReplicatedStorage/Video data"
```

- Default chunk size: 4 frames per file  
- Output: `fg_aaa.lua`, `fg_aab.lua`, ..., plus `manifest.lua`  
- Each file stays under Roblox‚Äôs 200k character limit

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Import into Roblox Studio

Use `studioMassImport.py` to automate the import:

```bash
python studioMassImport.py "game_files/ReplicatedStorage/Video data"
```

- Automatically copies Lua chunks to clipboard  
- Simulates paste + save in Studio  
- Requires Studio to be open and focused

---

## üß† Notes

- All scripts are modular ‚Äî you can run them independently or wrap them as needed  
- Manifest includes metadata: resolution, FPS, frame count, chunk size  
- You can customize chunk size, naming scheme, and import behavior
